  "description": "This paper introduces CATOM (Causal Topology Map), a visual analytics system designed to help transportation practitioners understand the causes of traffic problems in complex urban road networks. Traditional approaches struggle with the high-dimensional nature of transportation networks and are limited to analyzing pre-identified patterns, despite the continuous emergence of new patterns across interconnected roads. CATOM addresses this by using Granger causality tests to discover and quantify causal relationships between different roads through a metric called causal density. The system leverages spatial visualization techniques to make these complex causal relationships more interpretable for users. The authors validated their approach through System Usability Scale (SUS) testing and real-world traffic analysis at two study sites with domain experts.",
